# LSTM Brazil Streamflow Prediction

Computing streamflow from hydrological basin similar groups and country scale via deep learning.

## Overview

This project presents the first comprehensive assessment of LSTM-based streamflow modeling across Brazilian catchments using the CABra dataset, comprising 660 basins.

## Features

- Country-scale LSTM models
- Regional grouping by hydrological similarity
- Leave-one-group-out validation strategies
- Performance comparison and analysis
